  ### Autonomous vehicle : Google Self - Driving cars 
   --------------------------------------------

   * **Company's name** : **Waymo LLC**

   * Waymo states as its mission == to make it safe and easy for people and things to move
    around == The company’s investment in self-driving car technology is an example of 
    Google’s willingness to take chances on technology that may not pay off for many years.

   * Company's name : **Waymo LLC**

   * Waymo was first initiated by Google in 2009 as ==Google self driving car projet==
     and in December 2016 , Waymo was established as an independent company under 
     ==Alphabet INC== Google's parent company.

   * **The founders of Waymo** :

    1. Sepastien Thrun : German American computer scientist mainly focuses on Artificial 
       intilligence, computer vision, Robot Mobile Robot and Robotics in Artificial 
       intilligence, joined Google specificaly working on driverless car system project.

    2. Anthony Levandowski : French American self-driving car engineer. In 2009, Levandowski 
       co-founded Google's self-driving car program, now known as Waymo, and was a technical 
       lead until 2016. 

    3. Alphabet Google's parent company and Autonation are the most recent investors

   * **The Google self-driving car project begins** 

    The Google autonomous vehicle group of engineers set out on a challenge to drive 
    autonomously over ten uninterrupted 100-mile routes in our Toyota Prius vehicles. Months 
    later, we’d succeeded in driving more autonomous miles than had ever been driven before.

   * **Waymo company was first founded** 

    In early 2009 as the “Google Self-Driving Car Project,” By December 2009, the team had 
    completed their  first route, and nine months later in mid 2010, they had wrapped up the last. 
    In 2016 Waymo was established as an independent company under ==Alphabet INC== Google's parent company.  

    Waymo is funded by 12 investors. Alphabet and AutoNation are the most recent investors.
    Waymo has raised a total of $10.5 Billion in funding over 4 rounds. Their latest funding was raised 
    on Jul 23, 2024 from a Corporate Round round.
   
  ### Business Activities

   * **The spicific problem that the company is trying to solve**

   Waymo's driverless cars are coming alive at night, honking at each other and waking the residents around 
   the San Francisco parking lot where they sit when not making trips.

   * **The company's intended customer and the market size**

   Waymo offers Robotaxi services in Phoenix, San Francisco, los Angelos and Austin. They have about 700 robotaxi 
   in total driverless cars are expected to be owned by consumers for private transport.
   The global robotaxi market size is projected to grow from USD 0.4 Billion in 2023 to USD 45.7 Billion by 2030,
   at a CAGR of 91.8%

   * Waymo’s ability to “mostly stay clear of trouble,” along with its steady geographical expansion and its
   investors’ deep pockets, has put the robo-taxi operation ==into a very good position==. While other autonomous
   driving companies might be tempted to move too fast in order to justify themselves to their investors.

   * **Waymo Technologies**

   Waymo’s approach of designing both hardware and software from the ground up has been crucial to their success, 
   and it continues to pay off as they introduce their 6th-generation hardware. they’ve significantly reduced the 
   cost of their 6th-generation system while delivering even more resolution, range, compute power, and enabling 
   more capabilities.
   Their 6th-gen system builds on the unparalleled capabilities of their current, 5th-generation system,which has 
   been instrumental to helping Waymo scale their service to some of the densest cities in the United States and 
   improving road safety where we operate. With 13 cameras, 4 lidar, 6 radar, and an array of external audio 
   receivers (EARs), their new sensor suite is optimized for greater performance at a significantly reduced cost, 
   without compromising safety. It provides the Waymo Driver with overlapping fields of view, all around the 
   vehicle, up to 500 meters away, day and night, and in a range of weather conditions.

  ### Landscape

   * Waymo is an American autonomous driving **technology company**

   * **The major trends and innovations of this field** 

   Modern automotive vehicles are highly intelligent with a wide range of sensors that collect and process data 
   from in and around the vehicle. Moreover, advances in communication technologies allow vehicles to use this data 
   to communicate with each other and their surrounding infrastructure. Moreover, connected vehicle solutions power 
   traffic management, autonomous vehicles, and more to tackle traffic congestion and road safety concerns in cities.

   * **The other major companies in Autonomous Vehicle**:

      * Tesla
      * Zoox
      * Cruise
      * Baidu
      * Aurora
      * Ford
      * Nuro
      * Pony.ai

  ### Results

   *Waymo's self-driving technology is already proving to be far safer than humans and will only continue to improve 
   in safety as more data is collected. Moreover, the company's Waymo One program is already proving that the robo-taxi 
   business model is viable given the growing demand for Waymo's self-driving ride-hailing service.

  * **The metrics that are most widely used by self-driving car developers**

  The main goal of self-driving cars is to drive from point A to point B safely. To do this they operate 
  a pre-established map. We call this map a high-definition map or HD Map. Self-driving vehicles use 
  a combination of radar, video cameras, LiDAR and GPS to locate themselves and surrounding vehicles 
  within their HD Map.

  * Waymo, which is owned by Alphabet, introduced its sixth-generation Driver system, which features 
  a more efficient sensor configuration. The self-driving ride's new arrangement supposedly keeps safety 
  levels, even though it has less cameras and LiDAR sensors compared to the present platform.

## Recommendations

* I suggest that waymo company should work more on their parking system , they should collect more 
 data , work on model development and maintenance , train the robotaxi system to honk only in 
 a serious danger.

* This service will make the people that they are annoyed by the cars at night in their side 

* waymo company should use Artificial Intilligence analysis to train the robot more .

* **Improved vehicle safety**: 

    * **AI** can help reduce the number of accidents caused by human error.
    * Predictive driving capabilities: AI can help self-driving cars anticipate and respond to changes 
    * in traffic and road conditions.
    * Better traffic management: AI can help optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion.
