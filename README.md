  ### Autonomous vehicle : Google Self - Driving cars 
   --------------------------------------------

   * Company's name : **Waymo LLC**

   
   
   * Waymo was first initiated by Google in 2009 as ==Google self driving car projet==
     and in December 2016 , Waymo was established as an independent company under 
     ==Alphabet INC== Google's parent company 

   * **The founders of Waymo** :

    1. Sepastien Thrun : German American computer scientist mainly focuses on Artificial 
       intilligence, computer vision, Robot Mobile Robot and Robotics in Artificial 
       intilligence, joined Google specificaly working on driverless car system project.

    3. Anthony Levandowski : French American self-driving car engineer. In 2009, Levandowski 
       co-founded Google's self-driving car program, now known as Waymo, and was a technical 
       lead until 2016. 

   * **The Google self-driving car project begins** :
    The Google autonomous vehicle group of engineers set out on a challenge to drive 
    autonomously over ten uninterrupted 100-mile routes in our Toyota Prius vehicles. Months 
    later, we’d succeeded in driving more autonomous miles than had ever been driven before.

   * Waymo company was first founded in early 2009 as the “Google Self-Driving Car Project,”
